# Module: `management`

## Schema Mapping

| KCL Schema | Upstream ODCS Entity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ManagementPort` (`management/port.k`) | `$defs.ManagementPort` | Inherits `common.TagsDiscoverable` |

## Architecture Decisions

- Inherits `common.TagsDiscoverable` for the `tags`/`customProperties`/`authoritativeDefinitions` trio (see [common](common.md)); only `name`, `content`, `$type`, `url`, `channel`, `description` remain schema-local, matching exactly what upstream lists beyond that trio.
- `$type`/`content` stay open `str`: upstream gives them `examples` only (`rest`/`topic` and `discoverability`/`observability`/`control`/`dictionary` respectively), not an `enum`, and both are illustrative rather than exhaustive; new management-port content types are expected as the ecosystem matures.
- `url` is optional here (unlike `Support.url`, which is required) and is validated only when present, via `regex.match(url, common.urlPattern) if url`: this mirrors upstream, where `url` isn't in `ManagementPort`'s `required` list.

## Open Questions

- `$type` defaults to `"rest"`, matching upstream's default. If `topic`-type management ports become dominant in practice, whether that default should change is a spec-level question, not one this port should decide unilaterally.
- Same open item as [odps](odps.md) and [support](support.md): if `content`/`$type` should ever become closed unions, do it consistently with the other `examples`-only fields across the port, not in isolation.
